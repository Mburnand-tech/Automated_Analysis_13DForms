## :computer: Description

A Robotic Process Automation project I created with UiPath technology in 11/2021 while working as a Financial Engineer at FD Technology as part of their Capital Market Training Program

The automation is provided with the URL's of respective [13-d forms](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/schedule-13d.asp) from the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch) and produces an Excel document listing all companies contained in the forms. The document highlights companies that were disproportionately popular amongst the range of funds provided

The concept being that investment holding information when collated from various of the biggest and most successful growth asset managers in the world, could allow me to stand on the shoulders of their research teams to identify individual companies with above-average growth potential. This would not be an opposing strategy to investing in the funds themselves but to find outliers
