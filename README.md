## :computer: Description

An Robotic Process Automation project I created with UiPath technology in 11/2021 while working as a Financial Engineer at FD Technology as part of their Capital Market Training Program. 

The automation is inputed with the URL of respective [13-d forms](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/schedule-13d.asp) from the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch) and outputs an excel document listing all companies found in the forms and most importantly which companies where  disportionately popular amongst different funds invested in.

The concept being that investment holding information when collated from various of the biggest and most successful growth asset managers in the world, could allow me to stand on the shoulders of their research teams to identify individual companies with above average growth potential. This would not be an opposing strategy to investing in the funds themselves but find outliers.
